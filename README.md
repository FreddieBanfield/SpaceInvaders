# SpaceInvaders
I made space invaders using Java. All art work is my own.

I made this game back in 2017 (last year of highschool)

This game features:
 -  Two types of enemies
    - Astroids
    - Enemy Space Ships (that shoot and follow the player)
 -  Two types of weapons
    - Lazer
    - Rocket
 -  Custom graphics
 -  A reload bar
 -  Health Bar
 -  Points system
 -  Saves score to file
